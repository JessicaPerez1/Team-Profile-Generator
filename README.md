## Installation

- Make sure to `npm install`, from the `package.json` file terminal.
- The dependencies are `inquirer` and `jest` for collecting input and testing.

## Usage

- The user is prompted with questions about the team members thanks to the 'Inquirer npm package', after typing ‘node index.js’ command in the terminal.
- The user can input any number of team members, and information such as email, id, and specific information based on the employee's role.
- Once completed, a new `team.html` file is generated in the `output` directory, displaying all team's information in a nice, formatted file.
